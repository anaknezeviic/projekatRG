You can use the following keys on the keyboard to move around the scene:

W -> FORWARD,
S -> BACKWARD,
A -> LEFT,
D -> RIGHT,
up -> UP,
down -> DOWN,
I -> if you want to speed up the movement,
N -> if you want to move slower.


Apart from the basic lessons, there are also Cubemaps, HDR and Bloom.

Depending on whether you want hdr on or not, you can press the space button. 
Press the Q button to decrease the exposure, and E to increase.
